A few beers and two peices of pizza into a Saturday morning I received a group text from my older sister. It was a video of my nephew riding his bike without training wheels for the first time. As expected, I sent a message back with "Awesome!!" and "He's getting so big!"

Then I proceeded to send a picture of my then 8 month old son watching a movie. He had a scab on his nose and forehead of which my Dad immediately noticed and asked "What happened to his noggin daddy". I replied with, "Rubbed his head up and down on the mesh side of his pack and play. Was having fun making a pig face" My older sister said, "Oh boy", to which I replied, "Was laughing historically about it until it hurt"

Text-Mesage FAIL! So I proceeded to try and correct it by sending, "Histarically", "Wrong again", "Freaking phone". My dad replied, "Are you sure it wasn't the historic"

So at this point I was kind of embarrassed and decided to conclude the message with, "Hysterically", "Phew", "That was some rough texting fails", "Those were some rough texting fails"

So this was't over! I immediately looked to see if there was some sort of app that ensured your text messages were grammatically and spelled correct based on the context of the message... and much to my surprise it doesn't exist.

That is how it started
